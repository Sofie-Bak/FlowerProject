**An early school project where we had just started working with CSS Grid.**
The assignment was to create a small website using Grid for layout and to build a simple gallery section. I designed the entire website myself in Figma first, to get a feel for the structure and flow before I started coding.

I also edited all the images to match the look and feel I was going for, and used Grid to create a clean, organized layout across the site. This was one of the first times I really got to plan out a design visually and then bring it to life in code - and it made me realize how much I enjoy the full process from idea to execution.
